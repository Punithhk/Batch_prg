Each one of those three predefined channels have a pre-assigned file handle (or number) associated with them:
 •  Standard input ( stdin ) has the file number 0
 •  Standard output ( stdout ) has the file number 1
 •  Standard error ( stderr ) has the file number 2


CON : This special device is associated with the console. Anything written to it goes to the screen buffer, 
and anything read from it is interactively retrieved by waiting for user input.
 •  NUL : This special device, as its name implies writes to
  nowhere when it is used for output redirection and returns the E
 redirection.
 •  COM1 to COM9 : These devices are connected with the serial COM ports.
 •  PRN : This device is usually associated with the printer port.


To redirect the output, the command you type should terminate
 with one of the following redirection symbols/syntax:
 •  Use the “ > ” sign to redirect to a new file.
 •  Use the double “ > ” sign like this “ >> ” to append to an existing file or
 create a new file (if the file did not exist before) and start appending to it.
 •  Prefix the “ > ” sign with the output file number in case you want to be explicit. 
 By default, the “ > ” sign alone (without any output file number prefix) indicates 
 that stdout is being redirected. This is equivalent to using “ 1> ”. To redirect the stderr , use “ 2> ”.
 •  Use the “2>&1” syntax to have the stderr redirect to the same output
  as stdout . If stdout was redirected to the NUL device for instance, so will stderr
